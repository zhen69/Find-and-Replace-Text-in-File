# Find-and-Replace-Text-in-File
Implemented a program that reads command line arguments, perform search/replace on the input file, and print the result in the indicated output file.

The user use the -s flag to indicate which word/text should be replace and the -r flag to indicate the replacement word. The user may also input a -l flag to limit the range of replacement by stating the line number (start,end). There's also a -w flag that indicates the word followed by -s is a prefix/suffix of the words in the input file.

Note: The input order doesn't matter for the flags listed above. However, the input and output files must be entered as the last 2 arguments, with input coming before output.

Language Used: C

Concepts: File Handling, Algorithm, and String Manipulation.
