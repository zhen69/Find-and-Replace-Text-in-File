# Find-and-Replace-Text-in-File
Implemented a program that reads command line arguments, performs search/replace on the input file, and prints the result in the indicated output file.

The user uses the -s flag to indicate which word/text should be replaced and the -r flag to state the replacement word. The user may also input a -l flag to limit the range of replacement by entering the line number (start, end). There's also a -w flag which indicates the word followed by -s is a prefix/suffix of the words in the input file.

Note: The input order doesn't matter for the flags listed above. However, the input and output files must be entered as the last two arguments, with input coming before output.

Language Used: C

Concepts: File Handling, Algorithm, and String Manipulation.
